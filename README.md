INST 414 Final Project

For my final project in INST 414: Data Science Techniques, I decided to work with a [Spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset) from Kaggle. I wanted to see whether a song's genre can be predicted from the different data that Spotify has for each song-- danceability, loudness, acousticness, etc. I used three different classifiers on the data: K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression.
